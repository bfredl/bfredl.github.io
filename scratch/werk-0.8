MEMORY ALLOCATION
=====

starting point:
@xfree:s inside API Object:s: 44,871,810
            all other xfrees: 35,605,900

The former is presumably mostly with regards to msgpack-rpc, mostly remote UI.

After recieved API objects are fixed, implement direct msgpack-packing of
grid_line.

NOTE: of these:
 3,843,859 are RPC nvim -> embedder
  ~250,000 are RPC embedder > nvim

so where is the ~40,000,000 API freese??
