the marktree is a kbtree of "events"
An event is either the start or the end of a range (or perhaps a compact representation of an empty extrange = extmark. Or perhaps not, to easier support differing gravity).

event ID is like the range ID but LSB indicates 0/1 start end (or two bits: 10 start 01 end 00 empty perhaps). Probably range ID should then be even only (or 4-even lol).

The tree is "doubly linked", every node links to parent node, except root which link to NULL.
There is a map from event ids to the node that contains them.

subtrees are traversed on the "inner" key that comes before them. A key is never traversed by another key on the same node/layer

There is only _one_ extra set-of-range-ids per (both inner and leaf) node to keep track of "enclosing" ranges.
A range is enclosing a node iff:
  1) the beginning event is before the node and the end event after the node
  2) the range doesn't enclose a parent node (it is redundant then).

When a inner node is split in two,
  the additional ranges in enclosing set of the new split nodes can be found by taking the intersection of all the children?? (and then remove them from children)
When a leaf node is split in two, consider all the events of the other node manually (use the map to find non-leaf ranges)
