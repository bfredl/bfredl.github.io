- background of unicode

- The stoneage time: code pages
  - maybe a bit about DBCS ? (optional if too much content)

- some terminology:
  - Unicode is a Standard
  - a file is sequence of bytes, 8-bit integers
  - in order to interprete it as a text, an **encoding** is needed
  - ASCII
  - IEC_8859-1, latin-1 vs cp-1252
  - multibyte (UTF-8,dbcs) vs widechar (UTF-16/32)

- fun slide: acme as first editor with UTF-8 support, ☺☻☹.c

- grapheme clusters
- emoji

- multibyte support in vim and neovim:
- first builds of vim only supported single-byte text (latin-1 and similar)
- 'encoding' vs 'fileencoding'
