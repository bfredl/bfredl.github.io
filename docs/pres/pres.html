# Title: Neovim 0.5

---

# Agenda

1. Whoami?
2. Neovim: 0.4: grids and floats
3. Neovim 0.5: tree-sitter and LSP
4. The neovim community: the good and the would-be-better
5. what is neovim, really?

---

# Introduction

---
# Neovim 0.4

- lua "stdlib" initial attempts
- luv event loop
- multigrid
- floats
-

---

# Grids

screen.c was refactored to render each window on a separate grid.

shoutout: GSOC student 2018 Utkarshme

this allows some nice stuff, such as the float and the different font size.

---

- "Uis are just plugins like any other" @justinmk
- Thesis: a text editor should not be a window manager, pty master, etc. (unix way)
- Anti-thesis: a pty is just a pair of pipes and a weird low-res graphics protocol.
- Synthesis: more grids for everyone

---

- (INFOGA? low-res graphics using unicode blocks?)

Neovim is now half an tmux (and I did this completely by accident. We did not even think about it when w did floats. float win + term buf just work, as buffers and windows are orthogonal)

- A text window is a grid
- The pum is a grid
- The extra info next to the pum is also a grid
- The cmdline is a grid
- Messages is a grid
- Libvterm lives in a grid
- So we get term apps for free, like fzf
- A nested neovim worker is a grid (containing more grids, babooshka)
- Decorations can be grids (the christmas lights are already on)
- Lsp hover info is a grid
- Html panes are not really grids, but we can mold them in the same form
- A big clock is a grid
- Jupyter is a grid
- Lua output is a grid (and so on and so on)

# Neovim 0.5

- `on_bytes` and buffer ranges (extmarks, @timeyyy)
- builtin LSP (@tjdevries, @h-michael, @norcalli)
- tree-sitter syntax highlighting (@vigoux)
- framework for lua plugins (@tjdevries, @norcalli)
- `:smile` and `:nyancat`

<a target="_blank" href="smile.png">
  <img src="smile.png" alt="smile">
</a>

probably for 0.6 (but let's see)

- remote TUI (GSOC 2019 @hlpr98 )
- ui.c refactor (burning all bridges)
- rewrite ui_compositor.c to a real compositor
- rplugin rework

---

# @bfredl's autumn 2020

- Doing the Workâ„¢ 50% on Neovim quasi-officially
- Deliver Neovim 0.5-RC in time for christmas (TODO: shiny lights)
- less coding, more code review (so many people are coding already)
- Find the right person for each of my crazy ideas
- zig-lang plugin host (as @smolck has taken over Neovim.jl)

---

# community

Formalizing the unformalized:
 - member of `github.com/neovim` org, get 1 free membership badge
 - triage, can edit labels and milestones
 - write, can actually push stuff

or, limited access to `neovim/xx.nvim` repo.

---

# the uncanney valley

- Nvim has good `runtime/lua` etc
- a large cataloge of good/bad/ugly third-party plugins (show the "related projects" horrorshow)
- the "excluded middle": standardized interfaces _between_ plugins (incl UI:s which just are plugins, anyway)
- "frameworks" used by plugins (no dependency mgmt)

---

# the uncanney valley: how to fix it

- interfaces defined by *reference implementations* in `neovim/` and `nvim-lua/`
- `nvim-lua/*` as a sandbox for WIP interfaces, promote to `neovim/*` (or runtime already) when done
- example: (not about snippets only, please `:%s/snippets/\=v:lua.yourplugin()/`)
  - `norcalli/snippets.lua` should be promoted to `nvim-lua/` (IMNSHO)
  - a subset of the API should be standardized as the "official" snippets API.
  - user can swap in a different snippets implementation

- "strong defaults" and "flexibility/extensibility", **choose two**.
- `runtime/lsp` provides "out of the box" experience, but you can override any callback

---

# Can has package dependencies?

Similarily, Nvim could "adopt" one package manager (packer.nvim, or something else).
- define the "standard" for plugin dependencies once for all
- should be easy for all other active packagers to adopt
- "design by commitee" does NOT work when the comitee is over 9000 plugin developers
- Nvim core team should decide on one "good enough" solution for 0.5 (ofc discussion with large community, but we need to set the foot down)
- being shipped with Neovim 0.5 enough to bootstrap community momentum.
- can revisit before 1.0 (if misstakes be made)

- build system already uses luarocks, share it to lua plugins
```lua
 local cjson = vim.require'cjson' -- prompt user to install binary dep if needed
```

- @justinmk : reuse luarocks dependency mgmt even for vimL plugins

# "can you describe Neovim in a short sentence?"

but what is Neovim about, really? :confused_emoji:

**Hot take**: stealing/borrowing the best ideas from other text editors and giving something back

Also: about community
