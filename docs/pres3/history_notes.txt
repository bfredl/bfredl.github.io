[PATCH] Non-blocking job control for vimscript
> It is my second attempt to bring multitasking to vim, but unlike the
> event-loop/message queue patch, this one does not rely on multithreading,
> using only system functions available on most unixes. If required, it
> could also be
> ported to windows(I think it has a concept called IOCP which provides a
> replacement to the 'select' system call).
